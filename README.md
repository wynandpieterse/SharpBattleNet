## Introduction

Current build status:

[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/u180fx2lfy7bbesr)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/wpieterse/sharpbattlenet)

SharpBattle.net aims to be a complete emulator for Battle.net V1 and all the games that ran on it. These games
include the following:

 + StarCraft
 + StarCraft - Broodwar
 + Diablo I
 + Diablo II
 + Diablo II - Lord Of Destruction
 + WarCraft 2 - Battle.net Edition
 + WarCraft 3
 + WarCraft 3 - Frozen Throne

It follows in the same vein as [PvPGN](http://pvpgn.berlios.de/) but written in C#. This is intended to be a fun
and learning experience. What people do with this is their own resposibility. I do not endores piracy.

This project is completely open source, and community involvement is highly encouraged.
